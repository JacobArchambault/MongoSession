install 5 dependencies and our handlebars fix.

   npm install express express-handlebars body-parser express-session mongoose --save
   npm install @handlebars/allow-prototype-access

mongod needs to be running locally before running index.js

If the package.json file is intact, then the dependencies lisst in package.json should already look like this

 "dependencies": {
    "@handlebars/allow-prototype-access": "^1.0.3",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.1.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.0",
    "handlebars": "^4.5.3",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.4"
  },

if they do look like the above, then rather than install all these dependenceis, you only need to do this:

   npm install
